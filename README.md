# Blogasaurus

This is a simple web application that hosts a blog with comments. It is part of
the educational curriculum used at Google's [Computer Science Summer
Institute](https://edu.google.com/resources/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/).

Students work on this app in [multiple stages](INSTRUCTIONS.md). The code for
each stage is available as a separate branch in this Git repository.

You are currently viewing stage 6, which focuses on the Users API. A [live
demo](https://google.github.io/cssi-blogasaurus/stage-1/index.html) is
available.

This stage of the app can be viewed locally using `file://` URLs in a web
browser or hosted on GitHub Pages.

This is not an official Google product.
