# Instructions

1.  Create a single HTML page about yourself.  Use structured markup so that
    the elements on your page have the proper meaning.  Upload your one-page
    website to GitHub Pages so that it can be seen on a github.io subdomain.
2.  Create multiple HTML pages that are blog posts about whatever you want.
    Connect them together with hyperlinks, and create another HTML page to serve
    as a homepage/table of contents.  Create a CSS stylesheet to customize the
    appearance of your website and use it on each page.
