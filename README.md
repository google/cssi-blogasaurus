# Blogasaurus

This is a simple web application that hosts a blog with comments. It is part of
the educational curriculum used at Google's [Computer Science Summer
Institute](https://edu.google.com/resources/programs/computer-science-summer-institute/).

Students work on this app in [multiple stages](INSTRUCTIONS.md). The code for
each stage is available as a separate branch in this Git repository.

You are currently viewing stage 3, which focuses on serving static HTML pages
from an AppEngine app. A [live
demo](https://step3-dot-blogasaurus.appspot.com/) is
available.

This is not an official Google product.
